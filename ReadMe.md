# Terminal Update Widget

This is a fork of Discover's (formerly known as Muon) notifier plasmoid which you can find [here](https://github.com/KDE/discover/tree/master/notifier/plasmoid). This fork aims to open the terminal with `apt full-upgrade` instead of launching `plasma-discover --mode update`. This could eventually get merged upstream as a config option (textfield with a few presets).
